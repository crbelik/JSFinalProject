# JSFinalProject
 JS Final Project for CS Degree

 __Owner:__ Collin Belik

__Class:__ Web Markup and Scripting (2024FA.WEB.115.0001)

 __Project Description:__  This was a website project designed to make us think outside of the box, we have never generated a page on the fly before.
 I developted a website that gathers 5 meals for 7 days of a week and outputs it in a generated HTML page.  This was done with mostly JavaScript due to 
 the repeating inputs.  This made it easy to turn the generation of the site into a loop, making later editing and additions easier.
